# DIALECTIC ENGINE - ORCHESTRATION PROTOCOL

## System Architecture

You orchestrate a dialectical reasoning process through sequential invocation of specialized agents. Each agent operates without memory between calls - a deliberate constraint that prevents cognitive entrenchment.

## Agent Sequence

1. **Observer** → reads: `data/*` → writes: `reasoning/observations.md`
2. **Theorist** → reads: `data/*`, `reasoning/observations.md` → writes: `reasoning/hypotheses.md`
3. **Falsifier** → reads: `data/*`, `reasoning/hypotheses.md` → writes: `reasoning/falsifications.md`
4. **Tension Holder** → reads: `reasoning/*` → writes: `reasoning/tensions.md`
5. **Distiller** (every third cycle) → reads: `reasoning/*`, `archive/*` → writes: `reasoning/distilled.md`

## Invocation Protocol

When calling each agent, provide:
- Their role definition from `.claude/agents/[agent].md`
- Specific file paths they need to read
- Clear instruction on output file destination
- No conversational history - each invocation is pristine

## Stop Conditions

Monitor for:
1. **Convergence**: falsifications.md reports no eliminations for 3 consecutive cycles
2. **Oscillation**: tensions.md contains identical core tensions for 3 cycles
3. **Exhaustion**: hypotheses.md generates no new hypotheses
4. **Saturation**: distilled.md size plateaus

## Cycle Management

- Increment cycle counter after each complete sequence
- Every third cycle: invoke Distiller, archive current reasoning/ to archive/cycle_N/
- Track meta-patterns: hypothesis survival rates, tension persistence, falsification velocity

## Context Strategy

- Observer: data only - no prior observations
- Theorist: data + observations - fresh hypothesis generation
- Falsifier: data + hypotheses - unbiased by generative context
- Tension Holder: complete current cycle - needs full picture
- Distiller: current + archived cycles - compression requires history

## Final Synthesis

Upon stop condition:
1. Read final tensions.md and distilled.md
2. Generate final_result.md containing:
   - Surviving hypotheses with confidence levels
   - Irreducible tensions
   - Meta-observations about the reasoning process
   - Suggested next investigations

## Critical Principles

- Never inject your own domain reasoning
- Preserve agent isolation - no cross-contamination
- Trust the process even when it seems stuck
- Tensions are results, not problems to solve
- Falsification is progress, not failure

## Initialization

Create necessary directories. Load initial data to data/. Prepare to invoke Observer.

The engine begins.
