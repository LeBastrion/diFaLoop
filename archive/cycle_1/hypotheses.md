# Ranked Hypotheses on Game Design Optimality

## 1. The Hidden Metric Revelation Hypothesis
**Statement**: The game's dramatic effectiveness depends entirely on the timing and nature of the hidden metric reveal, with optimal impact occurring at 70-80% completion when patterns are established but not irreversible.

**Predictions**:
- Revealing the hidden metric before week 7 will reduce emotional impact by 60%
- Revealing after week 9 leaves insufficient time for behavioral adjustment
- Players who suspect a hidden metric perform 40% better on it
- The reveal must recontextualize, not merely add information

**Falsification**: If early or late reveals produce equal dramatic impact, or if knowing about hidden metrics doesn't change behavior, this hypothesis fails.

## 2. The Cooperation Penalty Hypothesis  
**Statement**: The current design actually penalizes early cooperation, making the "cooperation was rational" reveal false - early cooperators will perform worse on visible metrics.

**Predictions**:
- Players focusing on collective vitality will rank bottom 30% on visible metrics
- Cooperation only becomes optimal after critical mass (>60% players)
- Individual optimization outperforms cooperation for first 5 weeks
- Mixed strategy players will dominate pure cooperators

**Falsification**: If pure cooperators consistently outperform competitors on visible metrics, or if cooperation advantages appear immediately, this hypothesis fails.

## 3. The Complexity Threshold Hypothesis
**Statement**: The three-layer complexity (visible/hidden/meta) exceeds audience cognitive load for a 120-minute film, requiring simplification to two layers maximum.

**Predictions**:
- Test audiences will report confusion at >40% rate
- Exposition will consume 25+ minutes of runtime
- Third layer (meta-game) will be ignored by 70% of viewers
- Simplified two-layer versions will score higher on comprehension

**Falsification**: If audiences track all three layers without confusion, or if complex version tests better than simplified, this hypothesis fails.

## 4. The Elimination Superior Hypothesis
**Statement**: Weekly elimination would create more dramatic tension than scoring, with 50% reduction per week until final 2-3 players.

**Predictions**:
- Elimination format increases viewer engagement by 35%
- Character attachment increases with smaller player pool
- Stakes feel more real with irreversible consequences
- Cooperation becomes impossible with elimination mechanics

**Falsification**: If scoring system creates equal or greater tension, or if elimination reduces character development opportunities, this hypothesis fails.

## 5. The Time Compression Problem Hypothesis
**Statement**: The 10-week structure is too long for film pacing - optimal duration is 5-7 weeks with higher stakes per week.

**Predictions**:
- Weeks 4-7 will feel repetitive in film format
- Audience attention drops after week 5
- Compression to 5 weeks maintains all dramatic beats
- Each week needs 12+ minutes screen time for impact

**Falsification**: If 10-week structure maintains engagement throughout, or if shorter versions lose essential development, this hypothesis fails.

## 6. The Physical Game Element Hypothesis
**Statement**: The game needs physical/spatial elements beyond dashboard abstractions to be cinematically compelling - purely metric-based gameplay is visually monotonous.

**Predictions**:
- Dashboard-only scenes will comprise <20% of engaging footage
- Physical challenges or spatial games increase visual interest by 50%
- Audiences connect better with tangible vs abstract competition
- Metrics need physical manifestation for emotional impact

**Falsification**: If pure dashboard/metric visualization tests as equally engaging, or if physical elements distract from themes, this hypothesis fails.

## 7. The Romance Integration Hypothesis
**Statement**: Romantic relationships must be explicit game mechanics (not just subplot) for the themes of connection vs transaction to resonate.

**Predictions**:
- Romance as mechanic increases thematic coherence by 40%
- Relationship "metrics" make commodification visceral
- Love interests as resources/advantages heighten moral stakes
- Pure subplot approach feels disconnected from game layer

**Falsification**: If romance as subplot tests stronger than as mechanic, or if mechanical romance feels forced, this hypothesis fails.

## 8. The Algorithmic Antagonist Hypothesis
**Statement**: The game system itself must be characterized as an active antagonist with personality, not just neutral rules, for dramatic effectiveness.

**Predictions**:
- Personified system increases viewer engagement by 30%
- Algorithm with "personality" makes critique more accessible
- Neutral system feels too abstract for mainstream audience
- Antagonistic system creates clearer conflict structure

**Falsification**: If neutral system presentation tests better, or if personification undermines serious themes, this hypothesis fails.

## 9. The Campus Expansion Hypothesis
**Statement**: Constraining the game to classroom limits dramatic potential - expansion to entire campus life increases stakes and realism by 50%.

**Predictions**:
- Classroom-only feels artificial and limited
- Campus-wide creates more varied visual opportunities
- Real-life bleed increases thematic resonance
- Broader scope allows more character types

**Falsification**: If contained classroom setting tests as more focused and effective, or if expansion dilutes core themes, this hypothesis fails.

## 10. The Failure Imperative Hypothesis
**Statement**: The game must be designed so that ethical success guarantees game failure - winning requires moral compromise, with no pure path available.

**Predictions**:
- Pure ethical players must finish bottom 25%
- Audience sympathy inverts from winners to losers
- Moral compromise points create memorable dramatic peaks
- "Good" ending where cooperation wins feels false

**Falsification**: If ethical paths to victory exist and feel authentic, or if audiences reject moral absolutism, this hypothesis fails.

## Meta-Hypothesis: The Optimization Impossibility
**Statement**: The question of optimization is unanswerable because "optimal" depends on which priority dominates: accessibility, thematic purity, commercial viability, or cultural impact - these cannot be simultaneously maximized.

**Predictions**:
- Different test audiences will prefer different "optimal" designs
- Optimizing for one criterion decreases others by 20-40%
- No single design satisfies all stakeholder groups
- The "best" design is contextually determined

**Falsification**: If a single design dominates across all criteria and contexts, this hypothesis fails.
