# MERIT GAMES - ORGANIZED PROJECT NOTES

## CORE CONCEPT

### Logline
At West-Coast Thayer University, a visionary Silicon-Valley escapee runs a Life-Strategy competition to prove cooperation can still outclass raw ambition. Idealistic senior Wei Zhang and optics-hardened junior Cassie Keene fall in love inside the competition—until Cassie weaponises Wei's trust to win, exposing the human cost of a self-commodified age.

### Basic Premise
A drama with comedic and romance elements set in college, featuring a charismatic professor (like John Houseman in Paper Chase or Meryl Streep in Devil Wears Prada). The story centers on a lecture class with a two-year waitlist—a game theory and survival strategy course with a Hunger Games atmosphere. Students compete for interviews/internships at major firms, with notable alumni who've won having gone on to do big things.

### The Competition Structure
The competition involves students navigating strategic choices that affect their futures. The nature and scoring remain deliberately opaque, forcing participants to make decisions without fully understanding the system they're operating within.

## MAIN CHARACTERS

### Professor Ezra Quinn
**Age:** Early-50s  
**Background:** Former technologist, reluctant academic, "the barefoot technologist"
- Former Silicon Valley genius who left private sector to teach
- Growing disillusionment with tech's direction led him to try affecting young people
- Previously: Systems architect in Mountain View, built predictive tools for user behavior modeling
- His code was used (without his knowledge) in surveillance systems that preemptively detained protestors abroad
- Walked away not from heroism but dismay; academia was exile
- Now teaches barefoot lectures and psychological experiments disguised as curriculum
- Manages stress-induced atrial fibrillation with discreet chest patch
- The Simulation is his confession in code form
- Enneagram Type 5 (The Investigator) with 4 wing
- Core desire: To understand, master systems, avoid intrusion
- Core fear: Being overwhelmed, useless, or incapable
- Uses intellectual dominance to keep others at bay
- The simulation is a structured confession—testing whether redemption can exist inside what broke him

**Key quotes:**
- "The simulation wasn't rigged. It was calibrated. That's worse."

**Age:** 21, junior spring  
**Background:** Middle child from Raleigh, North Carolina

**Background:** Hangzhou-born scholarship student
- Only child of overqualified parents (mother taught literature, father was engineer)
- Memorized The West Wing to master persuasive English

## SUPPORTING CHARACTERS & SUBPLOTS

### The OnlyFans Arc
Beautiful male student at Colgate who:
- Gets $4,000 in parking tickets, can't tell tough father
- Starts OnlyFans, becomes top 1.2% creator
- Sells body part photos (feet, calves, arms) without showing face
- Makes $12,000/week from finance guys wanting weekly calls
- One client likes being "screwed over"—pays $1,000 for face photo, student keeps money without sending
- Eventually works at firm where client works, sees Halloween mask photo, realizes possible connection
- Questions: Does the boss know? Is that why he got the job?

### The International Student Dynamic
- Chinese families pulling students out as America's value questioned
- Super-rich international students who aren't worried about anything
- Other students trying to attach themselves to these wealthy kids
- The illusion of proximity to wealth as success

### Other Character Types to Develop
- The poker-playing student (quant internships decided by poker tournaments)
- The student who freezes under pressure
- The entrepreneurial twins who get pulled apart by competition
- The married student with photographic memory who attempts suicide
- Students who sell each other out for real estate interview questions

## THEMES & SOCIAL COMMENTARY

### The Most Rejected Generation
- 54,000 apply to Harvard, 1,950 accepted = 52,050 rejected
- Goldman Sachs: 2,700 internships, 315,000 applicants = 312,300 rejected
- Students applying to 150-250 internships annually
- 400 job applications with total rejection common
- Average knowledge worker job: 244 applications (vs 93 in 2019)

### Contemporary Student Life
- Sophomore year panic: if no junior year summer internship, life is over
- GPT graduating: all papers run through AI checkers
- Students asking AI to analyze and manipulate them
- Finance/consulting firms making offers sophomore year (age 19-20)
- The split: those with job offers picking apartments vs creative types in limbo

### The Meritocracy Paradox
- Success is opaque, gamified, and rigged
- Swipe-right, survival-of-fittest ethos in relationships and careers
- Short-term thinking as only way to stabilize identity
- The overproduction of elites—more knowledge workers than jobs
- Dark world mentality: world is menacing, institutions untrustworthy

### Quinn's Philosophy
- Pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will
- Prisoners' dilemma: "no" always gets something, but two "yeses" unlock real reward
- Trust and seeing beyond short-term betrayal gains
- Tech programmed for assured minimum gains, user dependency, engagement at all costs
- Testing whether young minds will repeat algorithm's cold logic or evolve past it

## SETTING & ATMOSPHERE

## STRUCTURAL MODELS & REFERENCES

- AI conversations and GPT interactions
- Video calls with masked clients

## CREATIVE TEAM DISCUSSIONS

### Budget Considerations
- $25-35 million range mentioned
- "For a price" film with real reach
- Reflecting unexplored cultural experience

## CORE MESSAGE

The film explores whether cooperation can survive in a world optimized for individual gain. It's about young people trying to orient themselves in an environment where establishing yourself seems harder than ever, where the chimera of immediate generational wealth competes with genuine human connection, and where becoming yourself fully might be the only real victory—but one that requires going through the system to understand its emptiness.

As Quinn knows: If we can't find a way to engage productively (not predatorily) with each other, there's no reason to believe we'll build tech that aligns with our higher selves.

The story asks: Can this generation break the cycle, or will they perpetuate it?
