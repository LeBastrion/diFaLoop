# MERIT GAMES - PROJECT DNA & VISION

## CORE INTENTION

This film aims to be a **diagnostic tool for our moment**—not a polemic, but a mirror held up to show how young people navigate a system that demands they commodify themselves before they know who they are. The writer wants to capture the specific texture of being young, brilliant, and desperate in 2025 America, where every choice feels both trivial and apocalyptic.

## TONAL TARGET

**"The upper limit of what is acceptable in Hollywood and still passing as smart without tipping over into being too complex."**

- Smart enough for the festival circuit, accessible enough for A24's core audience
- Paper Chase's institutional critique meets Social Network's verbal velocity
- Not preachy, not cynical, not sentimental—but humane
- Comedy arising from recognition, not mockery
- Romance that feels inevitable then impossible

## INTELLECTUAL LEVEL

The film should operate on multiple levels simultaneously:
- **Surface**: Compelling competition thriller
- **Intermediate**: Character study of ambition vs. authenticity  
- **Deep**: Systems critique about how algorithms shape human behavior
- **Meta**: Questioning whether any film can escape the market forces it critiques

The intelligence should be **embedded in behavior**, not speeches. Characters don't explain game theory—they live it.

## CHARACTER DEPTH PHILOSOPHY

Every character is **both right and wrong**:
- Quinn is visionary and damaged, liberating and manipulative
- Cassie is strategic and vulnerable, survivor and predator
- Wei is principled and naive, admirable and rigid
- The system is broken and functioning exactly as designed

No pure heroes, no pure villains—just people responding to incentives they didn't create but can't escape.

## ACCESSIBILITY BALANCE

The film must be legible to:
- **Students** who live this reality daily
- **Parents** wondering what happened to their kids
- **Executives** who might recognize themselves
- **International audiences** questioning American values

Complexity through **layering**, not density. Each viewing reveals more, but the first viewing satisfies.

## THE EMOTIONAL CORE

Beneath all strategy and theory, this is about **the cost of connection in a transactional world**. The central question isn't "Who wins?" but "What does winning cost?"

The love story between Wei and Cassie is the film's heart—not because romance conquers all, but because it shows what we sacrifice when everything becomes a game.

## VISUAL PHILOSOPHY

The simulation should feel **seductive then suffocating**:
- Initially gamified and engaging (dopamine design)
- Gradually revealing its own emptiness
- Never fully separable from "real" life
- Beautiful surfaces hiding brutal mechanics

Not sci-fi, not fantasy—**heightened reality** that feels one update away.

## DIALOGUE STYLE

- **Overlapping**, interrupted, stepping on each other's thoughts
- Smart people trying to sound smarter than they are
- Vulnerability hidden in intellectualization
- Contemporary references that won't date badly
- No one says exactly what they mean until it's too late

## STRUCTURAL AMBITION

The film should feel **restless**:
- Scenes begin in progress
- Information withheld then revealed
- Time compression during simulation
- Reality and game blur progressively
- Ending that reframes everything without invalidating it

## THE WRITER'S DEEPER GOAL

This isn't about condemning young people—it's about **mourning what we've taken from them**. The writer sees his own children in these characters, understands their impossible position, wants to offer not solutions but recognition.

The film should leave audiences asking:
- "What game am I playing without realizing it?"
- "What would I sacrifice to win?"
- "Is there another way?"

Without providing easy answers.

## CULTURAL POSITIONING

This should be the film that **defines how we talk about this generation**:
- Not "kids these days" condescension
- Not "OK Boomer" dismissal
- But intergenerational reckoning
- A bridge between those who built this system and those trapped in it

## THE NORTH STAR

**"Simplicity on the far side of complexity."**

The film must be sophisticated enough to honor the reality, clear enough to communicate urgently, and human enough to wound.

It's Paper Chase for the algorithm age—but where Paper Chase asked "What does it cost to succeed?", Merit Games asks "What does it mean to succeed in a game that's rigged, that you know is rigged, but that you have to play anyway?"

## SUCCESS METRICS

The film works if:
1. Students feel seen, not judged
2. Parents understand their kids better
3. The system feels accurately diagnosed
4. The characters haunt you afterwards
5. The ending sparks arguments
6. It becomes required viewing in sociology classes
7. It launches careers while critiquing careerism
8. It makes money while questioning what money costs

## THE ULTIMATE PARADOX

This film itself is playing the game it critiques—seeking prestige, cast attachments, festival selections, box office. That self-awareness should be built into its DNA. The film knows what it is: **a product that wants to be more than a product, made by people who know better but can't do otherwise**.

That honesty is its power.
