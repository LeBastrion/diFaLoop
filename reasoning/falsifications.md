# FALSIFICATION ANALYSIS

## 1. The Hidden Metric Revelation Hypothesis

**Contradiction Evidence:**
- Document states the reveal "recontextualizes everything" - suggests end-game timing, not 70-80%
- No evidence for specific timing optimization in the design
- Hidden metric is specifically "Collective Vitality" not generic

**Support Evidence:**
- Revelation arc is listed as key dramatic function
- Hidden information is core to the design

**Verdict: REQUIRES MODIFICATION**
The hypothesis correctly identifies importance of reveal but speculates on timing without evidence.

## 2. The Cooperation Penalty Hypothesis

**Contradiction Evidence:**
- Document explicitly states "cooperation was the rational strategy all along"
- Hidden metric rewards cooperation, suggesting it's ultimately optimal
- No evidence that early cooperation is penalized

**Support Evidence:**
- Visible metrics (Salary, Influence) might favor competition
- "Prisoner's Dilemma Extended" suggests cooperation has costs

**Verdict: ELIMINATED**
Directly contradicts stated design that cooperation is the rational strategy.

## 3. The Complexity Threshold Hypothesis

**Contradiction Evidence:**
- Document explicitly aims for "upper limit of acceptable Hollywood complexity"
- States must be "smart but accessible" - suggesting complexity is calibrated
- Three-layer structure is intentional design feature

**Support Evidence:**
- 120-minute constraint is real
- "Exposition burden" identified as potential weakness

**Verdict: SURVIVES WITH MODIFICATION**
Complexity is acknowledged concern but designed to push limits, not exceed them.

## 4. The Elimination Superior Hypothesis

**Contradiction Evidence:**
- Current design uses scoring, not elimination
- No mention of player reduction mechanics
- 10-week structure implies all players continue throughout

**Support Evidence:**
- "Would elimination raise stakes?" posed as critical question
- Competitive dynamics already present

**Verdict: REQUIRES MODIFICATION**
Presented as alternative to explore, not claimed superiority.

## 5. The Time Compression Problem Hypothesis

**Contradiction Evidence:**
- 10-week structure explicitly chosen and defended
- Each week = 1 year creates specific narrative weight
- "Weekly structure provides natural pacing and escalation"

**Support Evidence:**
- "Is 10-week structure too long?" listed as critical question
- Pacing concerns acknowledged

**Verdict: SURVIVES**
Question explicitly raised in document about optimal duration.

## 6. The Physical Game Element Hypothesis

**Contradiction Evidence:**
- "Dashboard aesthetics, leaderboards, crisis alerts all visually compelling"
- Digital metrics central to themes about algorithmic governance

**Support Evidence:**
- "Visual repetition" listed as potential weakness
- "More visual/physical elements" raised as question

**Verdict: SURVIVES**
Document acknowledges potential monotony of pure metrics.

## 7. The Romance Integration Hypothesis

**Contradiction Evidence:**
- Romance not mentioned in current game design
- Focus is on career/economic metrics

**Support Evidence:**
- "Should romantic relationships be explicitly part of game mechanics?" directly asked
- "Cost of connection" is central theme

**Verdict: SURVIVES**
Explicitly raised as design question in document.

## 8. The Algorithmic Antagonist Hypothesis

**Contradiction Evidence:**
- System described as adaptive but not personified
- "Algorithmic governance" suggests impersonal system

**Support Evidence:**
- "Game adapts, changes rules" suggests active system
- Personification could embody critique

**Verdict: REQUIRES MODIFICATION**
No evidence for necessity, but compatible with themes.

## 9. The Campus Expansion Hypothesis

**Contradiction Evidence:**
- Current design appears classroom-constrained
- No mention of campus-wide mechanics

**Support Evidence:**
- "Should game extend beyond classroom?" explicitly asked
- Could increase realism

**Verdict: SURVIVES**
Direct question in document about spatial scope.

## 10. The Failure Imperative Hypothesis

**Contradiction Evidence:**
- "Cooperation was the rational strategy" suggests ethical success possible
- Hidden metric rewards positive-sum choices

**Support Evidence:**
- "Forces impossible choices (no pure ethical path)" stated
- "Would darker ending be more honest?" questioned

**Verdict: ELIMINATED**
Contradicts design where cooperation ultimately succeeds.

## Meta-Hypothesis: The Optimization Impossibility

**Contradiction Evidence:**
- Document seeks "most dramatically effective" design
- Implies optimization is possible

**Support Evidence:**
- Multiple competing priorities listed
- "Film prioritizes" section acknowledges trade-offs
- Different stakeholder values mentioned

**Verdict: SURVIVES**
Document itself recognizes competing optimization targets.

## FALSIFICATION SUMMARY

**Eliminated (2):**
- Cooperation Penalty - contradicts core design
- Failure Imperative - cooperation can win

**Survives (5):**
- Complexity Threshold (with modification)
- Time Compression Problem  
- Physical Game Elements
- Romance Integration
- Optimization Impossibility

**Requires Modification (3):**
- Hidden Metric Revelation - timing speculative
- Elimination Superior - alternative not superiority
- Algorithmic Antagonist - possible not necessary

**Pattern Recognition:**
The document itself raises many hypotheses as questions, showing design uncertainty. Falsification reveals tension between stated cooperative victory and competitive mechanics.
