# FALSIFICATION ANALYSIS - MERIT GAMES IDEAL STRUCTURE

## H1: THREE-ACT TOURNAMENT WITH CASCADING ELIMINATIONS
**VERDICT: SURVIVES WITH MODIFICATION**

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Aligns with film's need for escalation and clear dramatic structure
- Wei-Cassie relationship naturally evolves through phases
- Elimination creates real stakes matching "Hunger Games atmosphere" reference
- Budget-feasible with campus locations

**Contradictions:**
- 100→30→10→1 may exceed "upper limit of acceptable complexity"
- Tracking 100 students initially could overwhelm 120-minute runtime
- Might feel too game-show literal for sophisticated tone

**Required Modifications:**
- Reduce initial pool to 30-40 students maximum
- Focus on core 8-10 characters with others as background
- Make eliminations feel like natural academic attrition, not game show

---

## H2: DUAL-TRACK SCORING WITH HIDDEN BETRAYAL POINTS
**VERDICT: SURVIVES**

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Perfectly embodies "deliberately opaque" scoring mentioned
- Hidden Trust Points align with Quinn's "cooperation can outclass ambition" philosophy
- Creates exact dramatic irony needed for Wei-Cassie betrayal
- Simple enough to track, complex enough to surprise
- Within "acceptable complexity" threshold

**No Fatal Contradictions Found**
- Maintains accessibility while adding depth
- Requires no expensive VFX or sets
- Serves both plot and theme elegantly

---

## H3: GENERATIONAL INHERITANCE MECHANIC
**VERDICT: ELIMINATED**

**Fatal Contradictions:**
- No mention of children/pregnancy in source material
- Cassie is junior (21), Wei senior (22) - pregnancy subplot inappropriate
- Melodramatic tone conflicts with "not sentimental" requirement
- "Legacy slots" too dystopian for contemporary realism
- Would require extensive exposition eating runtime

**Evidence Against:**
- Film focuses on immediate career pressure, not generational
- Characters motivated by visa deadlines and internships, not offspring

---

## H4: MEMORY PALACE COMPETITION FORMAT
**VERDICT: ELIMINATED**

**Fatal Contradictions:**
- Physical maze exceeds $25-35M budget dramatically
- "Massive physical space" impossible on campus setting
- Too fantastical for grounded, contemporary tone
- Shifting rooms = expensive practical effects or VFX
- Violates "heightened reality that feels one update away"

**Evidence Against:**
- Source emphasizes digital/algorithmic competition, not physical
- Would overshadow intimate character drama with spectacle

---

## H5: REAL-TIME DEMOCRACY ELIMINATION SYSTEM
**VERDICT: SURVIVES WITH MODIFICATION**

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Voting aligns with social dynamics theme
- "Eliminated players become power structure" matches systemic critique
- Could work within campus setting and budget
- Weighted voting creates strategic complexity

**Contradictions:**
- Managing 100 voters logistically impossible
- Voting scenes risk becoming repetitive
- May slow pacing in crucial middle act

**Required Modifications:**
- Limit to single elimination vote at midpoint
- Use digital voting to compress screen time
- Focus on coalition politics, not individual votes

---

## H6: SACRIFICE CHESS WITH HUMAN PIECES
**VERDICT: ELIMINATED**

**Fatal Contradictions:**
- Chess metaphor too heavy-handed for subtle tone
- Literal game board conflicts with contemporary realism
- Would alienate audiences unfamiliar with chess
- "Human pieces" ventures into Hunger Games territory too explicitly
- Requires elaborate set/staging beyond budget

**Evidence Against:**
- No game board imagery in source material
- Would make competition feel artificial, not organic

---

## H7: BIOSOCIAL CREDIT SYSTEM WITH REAL-TIME DECAY
**VERDICT: SURVIVES WITH MODIFICATION**

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Wearable devices fit contemporary tech reality
- Point decay creates natural urgency and exhaustion
- "Helping costs points" perfect for Wei-Cassie dynamic
- Aligns with "surveillance capitalism" themes
- Visual scores work cinematically

**Contradictions:**
- Too "Black Mirror" for mainstream accessibility
- Constant score-watching might distract from character moments

**Required Modifications:**
- Devices track but don't display constantly
- Scores revealed at strategic dramatic moments only
- Decay happens between episodes, not real-time on screen

---

## H8: BLIND JUSTICE TRIALS WITH PARTNER DEPENDENCIES
**VERDICT: SURVIVES**

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Information asymmetry creates natural tension
- "Can't see own scores" forces trust dynamics
- Perfect setup for Wei-Cassie betrayal based on incomplete information
- Simple to explain, complex in implications
- No budget issues - just performance and staging

**No Fatal Contradictions Found**
- Elegant mechanism serving both plot and theme
- Within complexity threshold
- Emotionally resonant without being sentimental

---

## META-HYPOTHESIS: GAME AS SOCIETAL DNA REPLICATOR
**VERDICT: SURVIVES AS THEMATIC FRAMEWORK**

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Aligns with Quinn's "testing whether young minds will repeat algorithm's cold logic"
- Matches "diagnostic tool for our moment" intention
- Creates systemic critique without preaching

**Must Remain Subtext:**
- Cannot be explicitly stated without violating "embedded in behavior, not speeches"
- Works as underlying truth characters discover, not premise

---

## FALSIFICATION SUMMARY

**ELIMINATED (3):**
- H3: Generational Inheritance - melodramatic, not grounded in source
- H4: Memory Palace - budget-breaking, too fantastical
- H6: Sacrifice Chess - too literal, heavy-handed

**SURVIVED (3):**
- H2: Dual-Track Scoring - perfect dramatic mechanism
- H8: Blind Justice Trials - elegant trust dynamics
- Meta: DNA Replicator - strong thematic framework

**REQUIRES MODIFICATION (3):**
- H1: Three-Act Tournament - reduce scale, naturalize eliminations
- H5: Democracy Elimination - single vote only, digital compression
- H7: Biosocial Credit - subtle tracking, strategic reveals

## Pattern Recognition

**Successful hypotheses share:**
- Work within campus setting and $25-35M budget
- Create drama through information and trust, not spectacle
- Serve Wei-Cassie betrayal arc naturally
- Stay within "acceptable complexity" threshold
- Feel contemporary, not futuristic or fantastical

**Failed hypotheses share:**
- Require elaborate physical sets or VFX
- Push beyond "heightened reality" into fantasy
- Prioritize concept over character
- Need extensive exposition to explain
