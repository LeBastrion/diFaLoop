# Falsification Report - Cycle 2

## Hypothesis Testing Results

### H1: The Critical Mass Threshold Hypothesis
**STATUS: PARTIALLY FALSIFIED**

**Evidence of Failure:**
- Simulation overview mentions "scaling from small groups to massive multiplayer" - contradicts fixed 7-12 limit
- No evidence of specific fragmentation at 13+ participants
- Plot architecture describes "growing community" without mention of size limits

**Partial Survival:**
- The concept of "critical mass" does appear in compiled thoughts
- Small group dynamics mentioned as important in early phases

### H2: The Parasitic Equilibrium Hypothesis
**STATUS: FALSIFIED**

**Evidence of Failure:**
- All documentation emphasizes "contribution," "merit," and "value creation"
- No mention of parasitic players or free-riders
- System design appears to reward participation, not strategic non-participation
- Challenge descriptions focus on active engagement

**Killing blow:** The entire merit system is designed to prevent, not enable, parasitic behavior.

### H3: The Binary Fork Hypothesis
**STATUS: SURVIVED (MODIFIED)**

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Explicit mention of "fork in the road" moments
- Binary choices between "collaboration vs competition"
- Different player paths and outcomes described

**Modification Required:**
- Not a technical blockchain fork but narrative/strategic fork
- Players choose approaches, not chains

### H4: The Emotional Contagion Coefficient
**STATUS: INSUFFICIENT DATA**

**Cannot Test:**
- No quantitative emotional data provided
- No player interaction metrics available
- Hypothesis requires runtime data not present in design documents

**Verdict:** Untestable with current data
