# Hypotheses - Cycle 2

## Ranked by Falsifiability (Most Falsifiable First)

### H1: The Critical Mass Threshold Hypothesis
**Mechanism**: Merit Games requires exactly 7-12 active participants to maintain stability. Below 7, the system collapses due to insufficient diversity. Above 12, coordination costs exceed merit generation capacity.

**Specific Predictions**:
- Systems with 6 or fewer participants will show exponential decay in total merit within 10 rounds
- Systems with 13+ participants will show fragmentation into sub-groups of 7-12 within 20 rounds
- The optimal number is precisely 9 participants (3x3 matrix of interactions)

**Falsification Conditions**:
- Finding any stable system with <7 or >12 participants lasting 50+ rounds
- Demonstrating linear scaling of merit generation with participant count
- Showing that fragmentation patterns don't correlate with group size

### H2: The Parasitic Equilibrium Hypothesis
**Mechanism**: Every successful Merit Game evolves exactly one "parasite" player who contributes minimal effort but extracts maximum merit through strategic positioning. This parasite is NECESSARY for system stability as they provide liquidity and prevent hoarding behaviors.

**Specific Predictions**:
- In any game lasting >30 rounds, exactly one player will have contribution/reward ratio <0.3
- Removing this player causes system collapse within 5 rounds
- The parasite always emerges between rounds 8-15
- Multiple parasites cause immediate system failure

**Falsification Conditions**:
- Finding stable systems with zero parasites
- Finding stable systems with 2+ parasites
- Demonstrating parasite emergence outside the 8-15 round window
- Showing system survival after parasite removal

### H3: The Binary Fork Hypothesis
**Mechanism**: All Merit Games eventually fork into exactly two competing chains - one "proof-of-work" (effort-based) and one "proof-of-stake" (wealth-based). Players must choose sides, creating a permanent schism.

**Specific Predictions**:
- Fork occurs at round 25 ± 3
- Player distribution will be 60-40 (±5%) between chains
- Cross-chain bridges fail 100% of the time
- The wealth-based chain always has higher total merit but lower participation

**Falsification Conditions**:
- Games remaining unified past round 30
- Successful three-way or higher forks
- Working cross-chain merit transfers
- Effort-based chain achieving higher total merit

### H4: The Emotional Contagion Coefficient
**Mechanism**: Player emotions spread with a precise contagion factor of 0.73. One player's satisfaction/dissatisfaction infects exactly 73% of their direct connections in the next round.

**Specific Predictions**:
- Measuring sentiment scores shows 0.73 correlation between connected players with 1-round lag
- Isolating a dissatisfied player prevents system-wide collapse 73% of the time
- Positive emotions spread at exactly the same rate as negative ones
- The contagion effect drops to zero beyond 2 degrees of separation

**Falsification Conditions**:
- Contagion coefficient outside 0.70-0.76 range
- Asymmetric positive/negative emotion spread
- Contagion beyond 2 degrees of separation
- Sentiment correlation without direct connection
