# Observations - Cycle 2: Absences and Silences

## Structural Absences

### Missing Agent Definitions
- No specification of who plays the game (age, background, number)
- No identification of who runs/facilitates the game
- Absence of where game takes place (physical/digital/hybrid)
- No mention of game's relationship to film production timeline

### Absent Failure Modes
- No discussion of what happens if players refuse to play
- No mention of players gaming the system
- Absence of contingency for technical/platform failures
- No consideration of players discovering hidden metric early

### Missing Measurement Specifications
- How are metrics actually measured/calculated
- What constitutes a "choice" or "decision"
- No quantification of "cooperation" or "vitality"
- Absence of scoring granularity or ranges

## Silence Patterns

### Unasked Questions
- WHO benefits from this game design?
- WHEN does the game occur relative to film?
- WHERE do gameplay sessions happen?
- HOW LONG is each weekly session?
- WHO owns the data/insights generated?

### Avoided Topics
- Legal/ethical concerns of experimenting on students
- Psychological impact on participants
- Consent and disclosure requirements
- Potential for real harm from game dynamics

## Implicit Power Structures

### Authority Assumptions
- Assumes unquestioned compliance with game rules
- Presumes students will accept arbitrary changes
- No mention of player agency to modify rules
- Silent on power dynamics between facilitator/players

### Hidden Controllers
- Who designs the adaptive algorithm?
- Who interprets the hidden metric?
- Who decides when/how to reveal?
- Who determines "winning"?

## Temporal Gaps

### Duration Ambiguities
- Daily time commitment unstated
- Gap periods between weeks unspecified
- No mention of real-time vs. asynchronous play
- Total production timeline absent

### Sequence Uncertainties
- Order of rule changes unspecified
- Timing of revelation unplanned
- No mention of onboarding/training period
- Exit/debrief process absent

## Emotional Dimensions Absent

### Unmentioned Affects
- Anxiety, stress, breakdown potential
- Friendship formation/destruction
- Trust building/betrayal impact
- Post-game psychological effects

### Missing Support Systems
- No mention of counseling/support
- No safety mechanisms described
- No opt-out procedures
- No harm mitigation strategies

## Resource Silences

### Unspecified Requirements
- Technical infrastructure needs
- Human facilitator requirements
- Budget implications
- Space/equipment needs

### Hidden Costs
- Participant compensation unmentioned
- Development/testing time absent
- Platform/technology licensing
- Insurance/liability considerations

## Outcome Ambiguities

### Success Metrics Absent
- How is game effectiveness measured?
- What constitutes dramatic success?
- No mention of testing/validation
- No pilot program description

### Impact Assessment Missing
- Effect on actual film narrative
- Influence on actor performances
- Documentary vs. fiction balance
- Authenticity vs. construction tension

## Meta-Silences

### Document's Own Gaps
- No version number or date
- No author attribution
- No intended audience specified
- No decision timeline indicated

### Process Invisibilities
- How was this design reached?
- What alternatives were rejected?
- Who participated in design?
- What constraints shaped it?

## Patterns in Absences

The document's silences cluster around:
1. **Accountability** - who is responsible
2. **Harm** - what could go wrong
3. **Power** - who controls what
4. **Resources** - what it actually takes
5. **Verification** - how we know it works

These absences suggest the document functions more as provocative framework than implementation plan.
